The sun rises in the east
Birds fly in the sky
Water flows downhill
Flowers bloom in the spring
Time waits for no one
Love conquers all
Dreams come true
Laughter is the best medicine
Life is a journey
Change is inevitable
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Actions speak louder than words
Honesty is the best policy
Knowledge is power
Practice makes perfect
Patience is a virtue
Failure is a stepping stone to success
Success is a journey not a destination
All is fair in love and war
Good things come to those who wait
Everything happens for a reason
Live and let live
The grass is always greener on the other side
Better safe than sorry
A penny saved is a penny earned
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt
