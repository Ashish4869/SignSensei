# SignSensei

This is the final year project, where we have developed an educational game that teaches players the sign language in a fun and interactive way.

# Tech Stack

1. Frontend - Unity
2. Backend - Flask & TensorFlow

# How to setup backend

- Initially, run the setup.sh file `bash setup.sh`
- For local usage, run the local.sh file `bash local.sh`
- For production usage, run the main.sh file `bash main.sh`

<b>Note:</b> `The setup.sh` file should be run before running the `main.sh` or `local.sh` to ensure that the application dependencies have been installed properly.

- The app.py file has a `--headless` option to run in headless (windowless) mode.
